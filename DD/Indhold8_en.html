      <p><b><font face="Times" size=4>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The sustainability principle 
        must be written into our constitution and translated into juridical practice 
        </font></b></p>
      <font face="Times"> 
      <p>Presently there are several legal barriers to a sustainable development, 
        and a conversion to a sustainable judicial system is called for. This 
        is prerequisite in order to truly safeguard the citizens&#146; opportunity 
        to take part in the decision process, and to ensure comprehensive evaluations 
        and the realisation of environmental considerations in all sectors. A 
        major step towards conversion to a sustainable juridical practice is to 
        constitutionalize a sustainability principle, implying both a right and 
        an obligation to preserve our natural basis and a clean environment. This 
        would promote a general conversion of the judicial reasoning and principles 
        based on which rules are interpreted and discretion exercised. </p>
      <p>Today the notion of sustainability does not form part of the Danish constitution, 
        which, more than anything, is coloured by individual civil rights, including 
        those protecting the sacredness of private property. </p>
      <p>One way this is reflected in jurisprudence is that a plaintiff will normally 
        have to be personally and directly affected in order to obtain a legal 
        protection of the environment. A new paradigm in legal thinking is needed 
        in order to guarantee that individuals, citizens&#146; groups and environmentalist 
        NGOs can obtain a statutory protection of common resources, nature or 
        the interests of future generations.</p>
      </font> 
      <p>Most modern constitutions have had sustainability added among their fundamental 
        values. For instance, in the 1990s, Norway and Finland had constitutional 
        provisions concerning sustainable development incorporated. In both countries 
        legal usage has thus helped promote a development characterised by the 
        understanding that private interest is not necessarily given the first 
        priority, when it comes to protection.</p>
      <p>The Danish constitution should lay down both a material and a procedural 
        right concerning the protection of common resources. Citizens must have 
        a constitutional right to an environment that ensures their health, and 
        to a nature with its productive capacity and diversity preserved. The 
        constitution must also safeguard the rights of both individuals, citizens&#146; 
        groups and environmentalist NGOs to environmental information &#151; to 
        share in the decision processes prior to the passing of regulations and 
        rulings, to institute proceedings before administrative authorities, and 
        to bring an action before the courts of justice. At the same time our 
        constitution should lay down an obligation of both citizens and authorities 
        to take a long-term and comprehensive perspective in utilising natural 
        resources, in order to also guarantee such rights for future generations.</p>
      <i><font face="Times"> 
      <ul>
        <li>We call upon the Danish government and parliament to initiate a constitutional 
          amendment in which a sustainability principle concerning the protection 
          of our natural basis is included among the fundamental values of the 
          Danish legal system, both as a material and procedural right, and as 
          an obligation for both citizens and public authorities.</li>

        must be introduced</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Times">Manpower must be made affordable, and use of scarce 
        natural resources and polluting productions and activities made costly</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Times">An ecological tax reform, to relieve tax on labour 
        and instead providing revenue from resource consumption, combined with 
        green taxes used solely to regulate behaviour, can change the economic 
        rules of the game to promote sustainable development. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Higher prices on resources and lower labour costs 
        will alter the composition of the labour market and the form of technology 
        invested on development. Thus we will be able to purchase more products 
        and services that require major inputs of human effort, such as research, 
        design, care, etc. Repairing will pay off, compared to discarding and 
        buying new things. Once manpower is made more affordable, we can afford 
        spending more time doing things properly. At the same time imports from 
        far away countries and long-distance commuting for work will be made more 
        expensive. That in turn will promote the use of local resources, and will 
        also speed up the use of electronic communication to substitute physical 
        transportation and travelling. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">So long as transportation is unrealistically low-priced 
        better electronic communication would rather provide new incentives for 
        travelling, to see the people and places we have communicated with via 
        the Internet. Tax on transportation is therefore of paramount importance 
        in order to prevent that IT advances produce an ever more resource-intensive 
        lifestyle. Also the boom in world trade foreseen in the wake of the WTO 
        free trade agreements must be countered. If world trade is not based on 
        a roughly &quot;realistic&quot; pricing of raw materials and costs of 
        transport, then the WTO agreements will have detrimental effects and further 
        accelerate an entirely unbalanced economic development, in terms of the 
        environment. </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><i><font face="Times">We call upon the Danish government and parliament 
          to proceed with a green fiscal policy that lets scarce natural resources 
          carry tax, while reducing tax levied on labour, and which lets polluting 
          productions and activities carry taxes, thus giving environmentally 
          friendly alternatives more competitive edge. </font></i></li>
      </ul>
      <p><b><font face="Times">Introduce consumption-based payment combined with 
        &quot;non-consumption rewards&quot;</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Behavioural adjustment via green taxes and economic 
        incentives can be put together using more or less efficient and equitable 
        means. For a number of fields direct consumption-based payments should 
        be introduced, and thus a reward on &quot;non-consumption&quot; and environmentally 
        correct behaviour. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">The applied principle should be double edged, meaning 
        that &quot;resource-consumers&quot; and &quot;environment-stressers&quot; 
        will pay, whilst &quot;non-consumers&quot; are rewarded economically. 
        For instance the cost of private motoring should be redistributed, so 
        weight-related tax on motor vehicles (possibly insurance premiums, too) 
        is made cheaper, the less you drive &#151; perhaps combined with a pro 
        rata tax levied per kilometre travelled. </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><i><font face="Times">We call upon the Danish government and parliament 
          to introduce the principle of &quot;consumption-based payment&quot;,

          and resources. </font></i></li>
      </ul>
      <p><b><font face="Times">Sustainability investments to be promoted</font></b></p>
      <p>Promoting investment in sustainable technology and projects based on 
        sustainability principles is of major importance. Such projects typically 
        cover a long time horizon, or otherwise fall short of the demands on optimisation 
        of economic returns. The pension funds have ample investment resources 
        at their disposal, bonded for a number of years. Our society supports 
        superannuation schemes via tax allowances, and would thus reasonably be 
        entitled to make demands on the investment of such funds. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><i><font face="Times">We call upon the Danish government and parliament 
          to demand that pension funds and other institutional investors invest 
          in sustainable development. In this a major step is to ensure that such 
          investors can also invest in SMEs and long-term projects without coming 
          up against legal and formal requirements regarding maximal return in 
          the short term.</font></i></li>

      <p><font face="Times">Based on a calculation of the ecological-environmental 
        scope of action, it is certain that the affluent western societies will 
        have to cut raw material consumption and pollution emissions by 90 per 
        cent, a so-called factor 10. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">A Nordic Ministers Council study on factor 4 and factor 
        10 concluded that given the known technologies it is now possible to reduce 
        resource consumption by a factor 4 by the year 2030 and a factor 10 by 
        the year 2050. It is also seen from the conclusions that this cannot be 
        achieved without radical changes of values, both individually and in society 
        as such, and law amendments. Researchers and environmentalist NGOs have 
        presented similar conclusions elsewhere in Europe.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">A factor 10 reduction would require technical and 
        material initiatives in the following areas: </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Times">Development and use of more durable products (longer 
          product life)</font></li>
        <li><font face="Times">Development and use of de-materialised products 
          (i.e. products providing the same service or performance with min. 10 
          times less raw material input)</font></li>
        <li><font face="Times">Increased reuse and recycling, also in the form 
          of industrial symbioses (in which waste from one industry is used as 
          input to another)</font></li>
        <li><font face="Times">An overall stagnation or an outright fall in consumption 
          (services and products per capita)</font></li>

      <ul>
        <li><i><font face="Times">We expect our government and parliament to live 
          up to the 1995 parliamentary decision &#151; that future environmental 
          plans of action will be based on the notion of &#145;ecological scope 
          of action&#146;. For the preparation of a national action plan for sustainable 
          development we call upon our government and parliament, to take their 
          point of departure in the notion of the ecological scope of action and 
          the level of ambition derived hereof: to reduce society&#146;s aggregate 
          raw material consumption and waste generation by a factor 10 within 
          the year 2050.</font></i></li>

      <p><font face="Times">As for CO</font><sub><font face="Times" size=1>2</font></sub><font face="Times"> 
        the Danish government has voted to reduce emissions by 20 per cent compared 
        to 1988 within the year 2005. The 1996 Energy Plan, &quot;Energy 21&quot;, 
        has targeted a 50 per cent reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by the 
        year 2030 compared to 1990. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">However, if Denmark is to fulfil her share of a global 
        commitment to stabilise global warming (and reduce it on the long term), 
        then a reduction in the magnitude of 50 per cent will be needed already 
        in 2010, relative to 1990! Considerable reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> are 
        feasible &#151; both in practical and technological terms &#151; without 
        necessarily causing a decline in welfare. According to the Danish Ministry 
        for Environment and Energy we could halve the total national power consumption 
        by consistently replacing electrical equipment by the most energy efficient 
        available.</font></p>

        approx. 300.000 enterprises hold an environmental certificate. Moreover 
        this would help to increase the number of eco-labelled products available 
        on the market.</font></p>

          buildings and spaces, e.g. via environmental management. </font></i></li>

        </font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Over the last decades rural districts have found themselves 
        in a vicious circle, with declining employment and earning potential, 
        combined with a deteriorating tax base and public service. Local shops 
        have by and large disappeared, leaving a shrinking local population, who 
        often have to commute long-distance to work in or near major cities. Today 
        the rural population use their cars mainly to move between the different 
        &quot;satellites&quot; of their everyday lives (work, childcare facilities, 
        schools, shopping, etc.), and the money spent on individual transport 
        in private cars does not reflect the cost for society as such.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">We wish that sustainable local communities be developed 
        also in rural districts, with employment opportunities and functional 
        service facilities. Incentives should be created in order to attract new 
        green enterprises and institutions, including jobs for the highly educated 
        and well-paid population segment. </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><i><font face="Times">We call upon the Danish government and parliament 
          to launch studies on how to create a business and housing structure 
          in rural districts that will also contribute to reducing individual 
          transport by private cars.</font></i></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Times">Moreover there is a need for a renewed evaluation 
        of which activities and functions to allow in the rural zones of the rural 
        districts. Objectives concerning more access to nature, multiple land 
        use and opportunities for experiments in ecological living meet with obstacles, 
        more specifically due to The Nature Protection Act and the zoning provisions 
        of The Planning Act, as enacted by the county authorities. </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><i><font face="Times">We call upon the Danish government and parliament 
          to launch a comprehensive investigation with a view to amending laws 
          and their administration pertinent to this area, including an evaluation 
          of benefits and disadvantages from a sustainability perspective. Basically 
          the zoning provisions of the planning act should not obstruct a sustainable 
          development in rural districts.</font></i></li>

      <p><font face="Times">However care should be taken that a more lenient practice 
        with small-scale ecological projects does not carry relaxations when it

      <p><font face="Times">In the 21st century the vision is for our solidarity 
        to be extended to the worldwide population.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">That will require a fundamental rethinking of the 
        rich nations&#146; development aid, plagued as it is with numerous shortcomings 
        and lack of efficiency. Aid must be internationalized more than previously 
        (multilateral aid) and be funded via direct international sources of revenue, 
        e.g. a tax on speculative foreign exchange transactions. Concurrently 
        aid must be converted from the existing &quot;alms principle&quot; into 
        statutory revenue sharing and equalization grants &#151; similar to the 
        system used between wealthy and poor local counties in this country, and 
        the beginnings of which are also emerging in the EU, via the Cohesion 
        Funds. Finally provisions should be made for grant aid to be made conditional 
        on democratic government and sustainable development in the recipient 
        country, and they must be subject to independent international auditing 
        and evaluation in order to prevent fraud and guarantee efficient use of 
        equalization grants.</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><i><font face="Times">We call upon the Danish government and parliament 
          to work for a conversion of aid to developing countries according to 
          the above criteria, in the EU, UN and other relevant fora. </font></i></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Times">However redistribution by development aid will not 
        suffice. Such aid must be complemented with new principles concerning

        access our markets without tariff barriers. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Moreover knowledge transfer through education, training 
        and aid for restructuring will enable farmers, fishermen and other occupations 
        in the third world to earn a better living, thus enabling sustainable 
        farming and use of natural resources. </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><i><font face="Times">We call upon the Danish government and parliament

        indicators must be developed</font></b></p>
      <b> <font face="Times"> </font></b> 
      <p><font face="Times">Up until now any evaluation of whether social development 
        trends are the manifestations of progress or retrogression has relied 
        closely on recorded economic indices, especially the gross national product 
        (GDP). As an index of economic activity for a given period, basically 
        computed in market prices, GDP is neither designed for nor suitable for 
        saying anything definite about sustainability. Moreover GDP as a developmental 
        target is based on a competitive concept, thus prompting international 
        comparisons with particular focus on material growth and cultural uniformity. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Making for sustainable development calls for developing 
        new and more comprehensive tools. So if we need a comprehensive picture 
        of development we have to abandon the notion of a single development index 
        and exchange it for a set of sustainability indicators. Such a tool will 
        consist of several quantitative and qualitative indicators, each of which 
        will gauge the condition, state of stress, or effort within a key area 
        essential to sustainable development. In unison such an indicator system 
        will integrate all aspects of a sustainable development and demonstrate 
        the interdependence between sectors. It must be able to say something 
        about where our development is heading on the short and the long term. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Sustainability indicators must be used both as a tool 
        for prioritization when preparing strategies and as a follow-up tool. 
        Indicators must be selected to reflect areas of concern and objectives 
        once they have been placed on the agenda as being essential to a sustainable 
        development. Furthermore such indicators must undergo current evaluation 
        and development, as problems and focus areas change. </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><i><font face="Times">We recommend that the Danish government and 
          parliament prepare a comprehensive system of sustainability indicators 
          comprising, as a minimum, the following general categories of indicators: 
          </font></i></li>
      </ul>
      <dir> 
        <p><font face="Times"><i>- Indicators of the physical volume of production/consumption 
          and nature impoundment: quantitative and qualitative indicators of material 
          consumption, energy consumption and land use</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times"><i>- Economy and technology indicators: indicators 
          of preventive environmental intervention, including indicators of green 
          investments, indicators of R&amp;D in and development/use of green technologies</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times"><i>- Social indicators: objective and subjective 
          welfare indicators, including health and quality-of-life indicators, 
          democracy indicators and education indicators</i></font></p>
        <p><i><font face="Times">- Environment indicators: environmental impact 
          indicators, including indicators of CO</font></i><i><font face="Times" size=1>2 
          </font><font face="Times">emissions, pesticide use, hazardous substances 
          use, and waste generation. Environmental status indicators, including 
          quantitative and qualitative indicators of air, water and soil condition 
          </font></i></p>
        <p><i><font face="Times">- Nature indicators: status indicators of plant- 
          and wildlife, living conditions and biodiversity; indicators of ecosystem 
          stability and regenerative capacity. </font></i></p>
      </dir>
      <ul>
        <li><i><font face="Times">It is considered prerequisite for the indicator 
          mechanism to be linked up with targets and action plans via a &quot;sustainability 
          budget&quot;, or with targets on what such indicators should show on 
          the medium and long term, e.g. in 5, 10 and 20 years respectively.</font></i></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Times">The selection of indicators for the said five general 
        categories will depend on the values and goals to be promoted by the social 
        development. Thus the selection of indicators cannot be made the subject 
        of purely factual decision. </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><i><font face="Times">We therefore call upon the Danish government 
          and parliament to make the selection of sustainability indicators a 
          key issue of the general societal dialogue upon which a National Agenda 
          21 has to rest, and a vehicle for actively involving citizens in defining 
          and leaving their mark on a sustainable development. </font></i></li>
