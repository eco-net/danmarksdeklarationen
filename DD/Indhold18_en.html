      <p><font face="Times">&quot;We - professional, voluntary and popular organizations 
        in Denmark - -&nbsp;herein, by our signature to the <i>Denmark Declaration</i>, 
        present a number of issues, values and recommendations to our government 
        and parliament, as a blueprint for a co-operation on the preparation of 
        a national sustainable development plan in Denmark in the 21st century 
        &nbsp;-&nbsp;a National Agenda 21. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">We support the declaration&#146;s themes as being 
        essential to a debate on sustainable development in Denmark. A national 
        Agenda 21 has to be of a comprehensive nature, which is reflected in the 
        generality of the declaration&#146;s themes. However that implies that 
        taken individually we are not equally committed to all of its issues; 
        nor do we necessarily agree with its every statement.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">We do, however, expect our government and parliament 
        to relate to the issues, values and recommendations brought up for debate 
        in this declaration. As our own part of co-operation with the Danish government 
        we will pledge ourselves -&nbsp;within our own scopes of activity -&nbsp;to 
        creating dialogue on sustainability and to integrating the principles 
        hereof into our own work. Such an effort will extend the debate on sustainable 
        development and reinforce sustainable behaviour in wide circles and contexts. 
        This our effort will make a major supplement to the endeavours of our 
        government and parliament, and will underpin work towards a national plan 
        on sustainable development in Denmark.&quot;</font></p>
