      <p><font face="Times"><b>Background of the Denmark Declaration</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">At the 1997 UN General Assembly on environment and 
        development (UNGASS), marking the 5 year anniversary of the 1992 UN conference 
        on environment and development in Rio de Janeiro, the member nations were 
        called upon to prepare their individual national sustainable development 
        strategies no later than 2002 &#151; strategies to be presented at the 
        UN environmental conference in South Africa that year. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">This task, which complements Local Agenda 21 by addressing 
        <i>national</i> structures of essence to sustainable development, was 
        announced in the Danish government&#146;s 1999 Nature and Environmental 
        Policy Statement.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">According to the government the task provides an opportunity 
        to focus on one of the most important topics of our era, and to co-operate 
        with large parts of the Danish society.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>

        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times"><b>The aim of the Denmark Declaration</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">The Denmark Declaration is a draft presentation to 
        the Danish government and parliament on what fundamental values and issues 
        their work with the national strategy should take as its points of departure. 
        Moreover the Denmark Declaration provides a number of recommendations 
        for government initiatives. The declaration is not preoccupied with issues 
        of nature and environment; it collates environmental with economic and 
        social issues, in concordance with the sustainability concept.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Furthermore the Denmark Declaration is a request to 
        the Danish government to open co-operation with the signatories to the 
        declaration on the preparation of a national sustainable development strategy 
        in Denmark. Such broad dialogue between government, institutions and private 
        citizens was an explicit assumption in the Agenda 21 document from the 
        Rio session.</font></p>

        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times"><b>Target groups of the declaration</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">The Denmark Declaration will be sent to 70 national 
        professional, voluntary and popular organizations, which are herewith 
        called upon, by their signature, to accede to the declaration before it 
        is handed over to the Danish government and parliament in early 2001. 
        Annex 1 lists the 70 organizations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Apart from these organizations, which will be asked 
        directly to accede to the Denmark Declaration, other interested organizations 
        and local councils and counties are also able to accede to the declaration 
        on application to Network for Ecological Education and Practice (Eco-net). 
        <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">The declaration&#146;s final target group is the Danish 
        government and parliament. In practical terms, however, seeing the preparation 
        of a national strategy through will be the task of the Danish government, 
        whom we therefore request to involve the signatory organizations in cooperation.

      <p><font face="Times"><b>Originator of the Denmark Declaration</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">The Denmark Declaration was first initiated by the 
        Eco-net which has been granted funds from the Green Fund under the Danish 
        Ministry of Environment and Energy and The Danish Millennium Fund set 
        up by the government to conduct a broader social dialogue regarding demands 
        on a sustainable development. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Eco-net is an association working towards general 
        education on ecology, nature and environment. The association has a board 
        of directors, chaired by Bo Bramming, cand.paed.bio.</font></p>

        <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times"><b>Organization</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">In the spring of 2000 Eco-net set up an Agenda 21 
        council of 41 members from organizations, local councils/counties, universities 
        and sector research institutions, the corporate sector and more. The purpose 
        was to create a broad co-operation on the formulation of the Denmark Declaration, 
        and the Agenda 21 Council was charged with the task of articulating the 
        first drafts of the declaration. During their work council members were 
        present as private individuals. Annex 2 lists those among the council 
        members, who were actively involved, and who back up the declaration&#146;s 
        themes as being essential to a debate on the substance of a national strategy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">The Agenda 21 Council set up an editorial group that 
        was given authority to prepare a first draft of the declaration and subsequently, 
        upon circulation, to work comments and more into the declaration. </font></p>

        <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times"><b>The process behind the Denmark Declaration</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Based on an exhaustive debate on an e-mail list, with 
        nearly 100 contributions by members of the Agenda 21 Council, a first 
        draft for the Denmark Declaration was written. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">In June, at an environmental exhibition in Copenhagen 
        (&quot;The Green Track&quot;), an open forum discussed the draft. Based 
        on that discussion (among other things) the Agenda 21 Council prepared 
        a revised draft that was circulated to the 70 national organizations and 
        to local councils/counties in July.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">The discourse on the Denmark Declaration peaked at 
        &quot;&Oslash;koTr&aelig;f 2000&quot;, a popular event taking place 17-20 
        August 2000 at the Roskilde Show Ground, with an attendance of 5-600, 
        during which the final presentation and hearing of the Denmark Declaration 
        took place. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">After the expiration of the hearing period, 1st September, 
        the Agenda 21 Council &#151; based on hearing responses received and inputs 
        from &Oslash;koTr&aelig;f 2000 &#151; prepared the final declaration. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Based on that popular mobilization the Denmark Declaration 
        will now be dispatched to professional, voluntary and popular organizations, 
        with a request to accede by their signature. </font></p>
