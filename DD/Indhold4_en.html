        Planet Earth</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Times">We all inhabit this same Earth and are mutually dependent 
        &#151; on each other and on nature. We wish equality for all people to 
        have a worthy existence with a high quality of life and an abundant nature. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Globally, technology is tying man and nature ever 
        more closely together into a complex fabric. Therefore it is in everyone&#146;s 
        best interest that all parts of our community are allowed to thrive. A 
        sustainable lifestyle implies that we shoulder the responsibility for 
        all cycles and interactions that we form part of &#151; both environmentally 
        and socially.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Man, our communities and nature must be made the centrepiece 
        of social development. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">We desire a development </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Times">that is based on the equal right of all humans 
          to draw on the natural resources of this planet, today and in the future</font></li>
        <li><font face="Times">that acknowledges that there are limits to our 
          consumption of raw materials and our discharge of pollutants</font></li>
        <li><font face="Times">that in terms of planning and management is based 
          on democratic principles of influence and participation based on a long-term 
          and global perspective</font></li>
        <li><font face="Times">that cares for natural processes, plant- and wildlife</font></li>
        <li><font face="Times">that respects the value of nature in its own right.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Times">Today&#146;s world is fraught with inequality, and 
        fulfilling the basic needs of the world&#146;s poor is of paramount importance. 
        As one of the wealthiest countries worldwide, Denmark should take the 
        lead in showing solidarity with those stricken with poverty and disaster. 
        Conventional forms of economic aid have proved inadequate. New ways of 
        providing help for self-help need to be developed, with particular focus 
        on promoting fair conditions in trade. These would require us, in countries 
        with large-scale consumption, to reduce our own use of natural resources 
        to a globally sustainable level in order to allow for others to increase 
        their welfare and utilisation of the earth&#146;s natural resources.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">The global ecosystems are vulnerable and irreplaceable. 
        The extermination of species is merely the top of an iceberg comprising 
        far-reaching deterioration of the living conditions of wild- and plant 
        life in most regions on earth. Denmark is one of the countries in which 
        the process is the most advanced. Most of the country has been built upon, 
        or is being cultivated as fields or plantations. Just a few percent of 
        the total area still holds undisturbed habitats with primordial plant- 
        and wildlife. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Nature is an asset in its own right, and experiencing 
        nature and its use is of prime importance if the present and future generations 
        are to comprehend the necessity of sustainable development. Hence, a concerted 
        effort is particularly needed in this country, in order to protect plant- 
        and wildlife and to draw on natural resources with greater care and respect.</font></p>

        good life</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Development of a sustainable society must rely on 
        insights into its inherent necessity, allied with visions for &quot;the 
        good life&quot;. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">For a while money has been made the measure of all 
        things, and an end in itself. Yet, to the vast majority of Danes material 
        needs are no longer the most urgent necessity. In more than one way the 
        process that first created our affluence has now reached a stage where 
        &#146;more of the same&#146; will do more harm than good. In many ways 
        what we wish for now runs counter to demands for increased productivity, 
        an intensified pace and increasing risks in a society competing to maximise 
        economic growth. Now is the time to give higher priority to other values, 
        and to draw upon our social reserve in order to achieve such goals.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">In the 21st century we need to develop social structures 
        that will</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Times">advance an accommodating and tolerant society, 
          with room for and need for all.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Times">increase our chances of an active, fulfilling and 
          non-attritional working life, with time for family and a private life</font></li>
        <li><font face="Times">stimulate our resourcefulness and let us be creative 
          beyond reason and necessity</font></li>
        <li><font face="Times">give us more opportunities for showing intimacy 
          and caring in personal relations </font></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Times">promote a healthy and non-toxic environment, both 
          indoors and outdoors, with clean air, uncontaminated drinking water 
          and naturally wholesome foodstuffs, without artificial additives</font></li>
        <li><font face="Times">let us experience a dynamic and untamed nature, 
          instead of a managed and hamstringed one.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Times">These demands embody an understanding of &quot;the 
        good life&quot;, in which wealth and development are not measured by money 
        and material consumption only. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Our technology and democratic legacy hold a host of 
        growth and development potentials within the immaterial realm: In knowledge, 
        arts, quality, caring, education, health, experience, communication, and 
        community spirit. Yet, in order to qualify our choices, we must learn 
        to take a long view &#151; both in political, commercial and personal 
        terms &#151; in which purely pecuniary considerations are not the decisive 
        factors. </font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> </font><b><font face="Times" size="4">The 
        local environment is the starting point</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Sustainable development is a social transformation 
        process in which new goals and values must be developed as we go. There 
        is no such thing as one sustainable society or one way of sustainable 
        living. However a sustainable community is per se a cyclical one, based 
        on renewable sources of energy. Therefore any sustainable lifestyle is 
        necessarily deeply rooted in wherever you live. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Globalisation has changed the extreme into the ordinary. 
        It is cheaper and easier to buy imported foodstuffs and petrol from remote 
        oil wells than subsisting on local foodstuffs and utilising renewable 
        energy. The global interchange of knowledge and culture has become requisite 
        to our wealth and quality of life; yet, when it comes to material resources, 
        a sustainable society will have to focus much more narrowly on nearby 
        and local sources. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">The norm should be for food, energy supply and raw 
        materials supply for production to reflect local conditions and resources. 
        In a sustainable society negotiating everyday activities and needs with 
        a minimum of transport is not only feasible &#151; it is also the easiest 
        and cheapest way. In practical terms this would also imply that it should 
        be easier to live and work in the rural districts, and in a similar way 
        &quot;more ecology into the cities&quot;, e.g. in the form of decentralized 
        energy supply, public parks, gardens and hen pens. Stronger local roots 
        will produce a wealth of variety, instead of global uniformity. Moreover 
        proximity will make our environmental and social context far more visible. 
        </font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> </font><b><font face="Times" size="4">Enhance 
        the conditions of the local community</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Today the tasks within the social service sector, 
        plus care of children, the elderly and the disabled are mainly overseen 
        by the public sector. This has turned many social relations into professionalized 
        ones that exist only because one party is paid a salary. Concurrently 
        many private social networks have gradually deteriorated, which has contributed 
        to a marginalization of population segments.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Every human being needs to be part of a community. 
        Children especially need to experience a community with several grown-ups 
        and a variety of activities. An upgrading of our welfare society should 
        imply that we strengthen private, social relations and local communities, 
        where everyone is needed. Strengthening the social and cultural fabric 
        is important, not least if the aspiration is for our culture to develop 
        in order to incorporate the ecological dimension.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
        <a name="5"></a></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> </font><b><font face="Times" size="4">New 
        life to democracy</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Technology development, cross-border environmental 
        problems and global exchange of commodities and services all imply new 
        interdependences and new solutions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">A stronger local mooring requires decision power to 
        local administrations and citizens and holds obvious promise of revitalising 
        participatory democracy. The national level will set out the framework 
        for local management, considering the overall cohesion via solutions across 
        the traditional borders of sectors and jurisdictions. If the civilian 
        population and the business sectors are to be mobilised in favour of sustainable 
        solutions and experimenting with new patterns of behaviour, the prerequisites 
        are new forms of democratic dialogue and co-operation, between authorities, 
        citizens, experts and companies. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">On the supranational level a political globalisation 
        must be activated, in order to protect local communities and shared resources, 
        and to counteract the adverse effects of commercial globalisation. There 
        is a great need for reciprocal international co-operation, to take place 
        in a wide range of civilian, legal, political and democratic bodies on 
        international level. Therefore experiments in new forms of government 
        and new decision fora must be carried out on all levels.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>

      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> </font><b><font face="Times" size="4">A 
        new economic law of gravitation</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Times">In the economic context nature forms the basis of 
        all production, including the capital generated by man. Our goal should 
        be to preserve the potentials of a sustainable utilisation of our natural 
        basis, thus enabling the fulfilment of future needs, yet to be defined. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Therefore, in a sustainable society the economic system 
        must clearly reflect the framework that our natural basis and common values 
        chart for our production and consumption. In it, the economic rationale 
        rewards consideration for the environment. The individual will not just 
        exploit resources ruthlessly, without at least paying a surcharge for 
        over-consumption or degradation of the natural basis. The sustainable 
        solution should be the obvious choice, because it is easy, good, and cost-efficient. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Also investment in sustainable production that does 
        not burden society with additional expenditure should be made attractive. 
        Sadly the opposite is often true today, since there is more profit to 
        be gained on destruction, selfishness and shortsightedness. This shows 
        that sustainable development will require the market mechanisms to be 
        adjusted so they act upon the volume and character of production, consumption, 
        and investment. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Yet there are domains where the market mechanism is 
        incapable of making production and consumption take a sustainable turn, 
        and where political decisions are called for.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> </font><b><font face="Times" size="4">Technology 
        needs to underpin humanity</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Technology is capable of reinforcing man&#146;s appropriation 
        of nature; yet technology can also offer the methods and tools needed 
        for a good life, without transgressing the framework set by sustainability. 
        The purpose of technology should be to support mankind, enabling us to 
        experience and draw upon the essence of being human.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Recent developments in biotech sciences and artificial 
        intelligence have, in a fundamental way, challenged man&#146;s role and 
        the meaning of being human. They have shown us that we cannot let technology 
        evolve detached from the values and goals of our social development. To 
        us genetic engineering and interference with the most fundamental life 
        processes do not make sense if the sole purpose is to obtain a short-term 
        competitive advantage in the market. It is of prime importance that we 
        manage to redirect the technological development. Otherwise we risk being 
        left as strangers in a world enslaved by mechanisms of our own making. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">One important perspective of our technological development 
        has to be a more efficient utilisation of scarce natural resources. Basically 
        a sustainable society should base its technologies on non-toxic, biodegradable 
        and reusable materials and renewable energy sources. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">These are the goals we have to bear in mind when evaluating 
        and specifying demands for new technology.</font></p>

        to a sustainable society</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Today, at the start of the 21st century, society&#146;s 
        structural and organisational layout, legislation, and economic system 
        remain cut out to support an industrialism based on continued growth in 
        resource consumption. This presents a number of barriers to a sustainable 
        course of action. These barriers must be identified, and our systems be 
        changed to address the realities and goals of a new era. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">We need to organise a society that favours sustainable 
        production and makes it obvious and easy to go for a sustainable lifestyle, 
        both in the urban and rural environment. A sustainable lifestyle can also 
        be a positive choice: a choice made because it is attractive, challenging, 
        gratifying, meaningful, beautiful, and pleasing. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">On the one hand such a conversion process is about 
        activating development, innovative thinking and experimentation: new organisational 
        structures, new decision fora, new forms of production, new technologies, 
        and new lifestyles. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">On the other hand it is about exposing and phasing 
        out legislative, economic, organisational and cultural structures that 
        support non-sustainable production modes and ways of life, and impede 
        sustainable solutions. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Such a conversion will call for everyone in a society 
        to be involved, and on all levels. An effort is needed from our government 
        and parliament to promote, assist and prepare the way for local and private 
        contributions. An effort is also needed to ensure the comprehensive view 
        and the global perspective, and to further international co-operation 
        on sustainability.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times">We believe that most people do wish to contribute 
        to a sustainable Planet Earth, joining forces with others, with active 
        contributions from their parliament, government and authorities, and with 
        true influence on the development. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times">Against that background we submit the following recommendations 
        for a national sustainable development strategy in Denmark.</font></p>
